> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- I was worried when I first read the description. I just needed to internalize the assignment. I had just a little of testing experience from work. We had a new application that I was testing as a user, and we used Jira also. So I was intrigued about testing. When I got througt the module 7 (for the second time) I understood what I needed to do. I enjoyed doing the test cases and doing the tests.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- At firts I thought of possible positive and negative tests from examples an a few others. I wrote down few possible steps. Then I wennt throug the test cases to write down steps for test cases. Module 7 section 2, especially the two videos in part 2 helped a lot in this process.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 - I did do the exercise from 7.2 part 2 with excel (video), I enjoy excel. Jira I have used at work also for bug reports, and it's simple to use.    


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I used Visual Studio Code, we have used it a lot studying.


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- I think my biggest problem was starting and undestanding the assignment.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I have used Github in previous courses, such as Basics of programming and Web application development with Javascript. I think Github is pretty easy to use.
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- I think I would use Robot framework or Cypress. In my opinion they seem sipler than the others. The seem beginner friendly.



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- Expertise with tools like Selenium, Cypress, Robot Framework
- Programming skills in Python and Java
- API testing knowledge, particularly with REST API
- DevOps practices and CI/CD pipeline experience
- Agile methodology experience
- Test management tools like Jira, HP ALM, qTest, and Rally 
- Knowledge such as Guidewire testing 
- Database skills, especially SQL



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- I need to continue Java/python studies, experiment in the testing and test management tool and continue database studies.




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
-I think it worked for me. I was interested in testing before and this course only increased my interests. Thank you for teaching.
